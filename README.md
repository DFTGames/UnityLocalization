Unity Localization
==================

This project is meant to give no-nonsense,
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) compliant implementation of
a Localization System for Unity. The main requirements we try to satisfy here
are:

 

-   Use simple text files, easy to send to translators, no Unity required for
    them

-   Allow full UI localization (including sprites)

 

The code is published “as is”, exactly the way we use it. Feel free to use it
the way you see fit.
