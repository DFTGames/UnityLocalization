DFT Games Localization Solution
-------------------------------
This package delivers 2 independent features:
	*) Text localization (both UGUI and Text Mesh Pro)
	*) UI Images localization (2D Sprites)

Two are the steps to implement localization:
	1) Prepare the localized files
	2) Add the script to the UI elements you want to localize 
	
-- Localized Files --
The necessary files must be located in the following folders:
	Resources\localization
		Here you add the language files. Each file must be named following the scheme <LanguageName>.txt
		so for English you'll create a file named English.txt, for Italian the file will be Italian.txt 
		and so on.
		The file content is: one key/value per line. valid key/value separator are the equal sign and the Tab character.
		To add a newline simply use the sequence \n 
	
	Resources\localization\UI\<LanguageName>
		Be sure to use the same sprite name for all its version and store each sprite in its language specific folder.

The language name must be one of those listed here: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemLanguage.html

Once you have prepared the files all you have to do is to add the correct script component to the UI element you want to localize.
	LocalizeImage for the UI Images
	Localize for the UGUI Text
	LocalizeTM for Text Mesh Pro UGUI
